            <h1>What is Deforestation</h1>
            <p>Deforestation refers to the widespread removal of forests, leading to a significant reduction in forested land. Often driven by human activities such as agriculture, logging, infrastructure development, and urban expansion, deforestation is essentially the purposeful clearing of forested land. Throughout history and into modern times, forests have been razed to make space for agriculture and animal grazing, and to obtain wood for fuel, manufacturing, and construction.</p>

                <h2>A Historical Overview of Global Deforestation</h2>
                <p>Deforestation has greatly altered landscapes around the world. About 2,000 years ago, 80 percent of Western Europe was forested; today the figure is 34 percent. In North America, about half of the forests in the eastern part of the continent were cut down from the 1600s to the 1870s for timber and agriculture.</p>

                <h2>The Causes of Deforestation: Why Is It Happening?</h2>
                <p>Multiple factors, either of human or natural origin, cause deforestation. Natural factors include natural forest fires or parasite-caused diseases which can result in deforestation. Nevertheless, human activities are among the main causes of global deforestation.</p>
