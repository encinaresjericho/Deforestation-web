            <h1>The Causes of Deforestation: Why Is It Happening?</h1>
            <p>Multiple factors, either of human or natural origin, cause deforestation. Natural factors include natural forest fires or parasite-caused diseases which can result in deforestation. Nevertheless, human activities are among the main causes of global deforestation. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the expansion of agriculture caused nearly 80% of global deforestation, with the construction of infrastructures such as roads or dams, together with mining activities and urbanization, making up the remaining causes of deforestation.</p>
            <li>Agricultural Expansion:</li>
            <p>The need for more agricultural land to feed a growing population has led to extensive deforestation, especially in regions like the Amazon rainforest and Southeast Asia.</p>
            <li>Logging:</li>
            <p>Commercial logging for timber and paper products is a major contributor to deforestation, particularly in tropical regions where valuable hardwoods are harvested.            </p>
            <li>Infrastructure Development:</li>
            <p>Construction of roads, highways, dams, and other infrastructure projects often requires clearing large areas of forest, fragmenting habitats and disrupting ecosystems.</p>
            <li>Urbanization:</li>
            <p>Rapid urban growth necessitates the conversion of forested land into cities and suburbs, leading to the loss of valuable forest ecosystems.</p>
            <li>Mining:</li>
            <p>Extraction of minerals and resources from beneath forested areas often involves clearing trees and can result in widespread environmental degradation.</p>
